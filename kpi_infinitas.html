					<h1>KPIs for Infinitas Learning</h1>
				</div>
			</div>
		</div>
		<div>
			<div class="inner-container">
				<h1>The customer</h1>
				<p><b>Infinitas Learning</b> is an international group of educational book publisher companies from <b>Belgium</b>, the <b>Netherlands</b> and <b>Sweden</b>. Alongside the classical printed materials, Infinitas has entered the digital market as well. They offer online books, exercises, so as several online platforms. Products range from online courses for adults to educational games for kids and learning management systems for teachers.</p>
			</div>
		</div>
		<div>
			<div class="inner-container">
				<h1>The task</h1>
				<p>I was responsible to set up common KPIs for the group for their digital solutions. The task was to create benchmarks to evaluate the success of the online products across the countries and over time. The platforms have very different functionalities, target groups and strategies. Therefore the challenge was to find KPIs which can be applied for the wide variety of products.</p>
			</div>
		</div>
		<div>
			<div class="inner-container">
				<blockquote>The goal was to set up metrics which can be used for standard UX evaluations on regular basis over platforms and countries.</blockquote>
			</div>
		</div>
		<div>
			<div class="inner-container">
				<h1>The metrics</h1>
				<p>First with the help of business I have selected the representative  future-proof products which we wanted to measure in the long run.<br/>Once the platforms were chosen I analysed their targets, their goals and features, trying to establish a common ground. I was focusing on two aspects: <b>user behaviour</b> and <b>user satisfaction</b>.</p>
			</div>
		</div>
		<div>
			<div class="inner-container">
				<h1>Part 1: User behaviour </h1>
				<h2>Retention, usage and engagement, has been chosen as metrics to evaluate our platforms.</h2>
			</div>
		</div>
		<div>
			<div class="inner-container">
				<h3>Retention</h3>
				<p>We were measuring, of course, the percentage of returning visitors.  We would like teachers to use our platforms, content as part of their everyday work, learning process. Therefore, yes we are happy if we have <b>returning visitiors</b> but we can only be satisfied if our teachers, students use our products at least on weekly basis. Therefore we started to measure the percentage of users who are interacting with our platform on a weekly basis.  </p>

				<h3>Usage</h3>
				<p>There can be several indications of usage for different types of platforms and websites. For this set of products, we determined the opening of content as the main indicator of <b>usage</b>. We were already measuring the content usage directly from LOG files. This was helping managers to define the success of our different online books etc. What we were interested here is the usage but in relation to the visits. Therefore we set up a benchmark to measure the percentage of visitors who actually interact with our content.</p>

				<h3>Engagement</h3>
				<p>The third part of user behaviour we set to measure was engagement. We were measuring the percentage of users who spend at least pre-defined amount of time on our platforms. The time lapse was set rather high, as our products are not classical commercial websites but web applications.</p>
			</div>
		</div>
		<div>
			<div class="inner-container">
				<h1>Part 2: User satisfaction</h1>
				<div>NPS</div><div>+</div><div>SUS</div>
			</div>
		</div>
		<div>
			<div class="inner-container">
				<p>The other aspect of our measurement was <b>user satisfaction</b>.<br/> I personally believe that qualitative user research techniques are the best ways to understand our users’ goals, motivation, satisfaction or frustration.<br/>However, because of the different nature of the platforms, these methods were not feasible on a group level for a continuous, centralised assessment. We needed to quantify user experience and use generic measurement tools which can be applied for our wide variety of products. From a large number of tools, we have chosen to measure <b>NPS</b> and <b>SUS</b>. Both metrics are designed to measure  self-indicated satisfaction of the users. While NPS is only measuring the overall satisfaction, SUS is more detailed and focused on the perceived usability of the platforms.</p>
			</div>
		</div>
		<div>
			<div class="inner-container">
				<h1>The execution and planning</h1>
				<p>Both user behaviour and user satisfaction metrics were set up to for the long run. We committed ourselves to measure twice a year. <br/>We excluded all schools holidays such as summer holiday and Christmas holidays from our planning, as they would influence heavily our results and would make us draw faulty conclusions. <br/>In the given time periods all the three companies were running the same metrics and measurement. We would then compare the results among products, companies and what is more important to the previous results. The plan is to repeat those measure every year.</p>
			</div>
		</div>
		<div>
			<div class="inner-container">
				<blockquote>Online metrics are important to measure our products’ performance, but qualitative user research is crucial to understand our users. </blockquote>
			</div>
		</div>
		<div>
			<div class="inner-container">
				<h1>Training</h1>
				<p>So the benchmarks were set up, it was all ready to measure our platforms’ success, and our users’ satisfaction. But how will we build successful platforms? The only way to create delighting products for our customers if we understand them. The online questionnaires, metrics will never give us an in-depth insight into their behaviour, feelings, opinion. We will never get answers for our why’s. I can’t emphasize enough the importance of <b>qualitative user research</b>. <br/>Therefore I created <b>guidelines</b> and held <b>training</b> on <b>user research</b> and <b>usability tests</b>. I give practical tips for the product teams in the different countries to help them understand their users. This will ensure that the companies not only know how to measure the success of their platforms but to understand how to build a successful product based on their users’ needs</p>
