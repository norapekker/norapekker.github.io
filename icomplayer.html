				<h1>The customer</h1>
				<p><b>Infinitas Learning</b> is an international group of educational book publisher companies from <b>Belgium</b>, the <b>Netherlands</b> and <b>Sweden</b>. Alongside the classical printed materials, Infinitas has entered the digital market as well. They offer online books, exercises, so as several online platforms. Products range from online courses for adults to educational games for kids and learning management systems for teachers.</p>

				<h1>The project</h1>
				<p>My task was to create an <b>exercise</b> player for <b>primary education</b>. It would enable children to make homework online or practice in the class and the results would automatically be available for the teacher.</p><p>This was a crucial step for the group on their way to start offering blended solutions. Education has changed, teachers started to mix digital and classical techniques in the classrooms. We had to address the new needs.</p>

				<p>The project started with understanding the <b>business needs</b>. I interviewed management and publishers. It was important to fully crystallize the business needs and the <b>aspect of authoring</b>.</p><p>After that, I started and extended <b>user research</b>. Me and my colleagues went to do <b>field studies</b> in schools. We were observing everyday life at Primary schools. We were attending classes and following their day.  We also <b>interviewed</b> several teachers. But of course, the final users will be students. Besides the general <b>observation</b>, I was also curious how do they interact with online tools. So I planned and organised guided observations. I gave children tasks to interact with different platforms or prototypes like at a usability test. But this time I was not testing those products just observing and learning about how the children interact with them.</p>

				<h1>Ideation + Continuous testing</h1>
			</div>
		</div>
		<div>
			<div class="inner-container">
				<p>After <b>analysing the research data</b> and clarifying the high-level user needs I divided the project into <b>smaller chunks</b>, which can be designed and developed in a relatively small time period in order to make sure we can work smoothly with the <b>agile development team</b>. <br/>For example, each interaction type was a separate chunk, or the navigation elements, the evaluations, showing hints etc. I would pick a task, do some more research on that specific topic. After the ideation phase, I would turn them into <b>low or medium fidelity prototype</b> and go out immediately and test them.</p><p>Working with small parts at a time gave me a lot of flexibility and chance to do <b>continuous quick tests and iterate the design</b>, because of the limited scope of each part.  We built up long-term relationships with schools where we could go and do quick usability tests after a design chunk.</p><p>As the chunks were so small both the ideation, testing and interaction could be done fast and we were able to <b>continuously deliver designs to the developer team</b>.        </p>

				<h1>UI + customisation</h1>
				<p>At this project the most important aspect if the UI was to be <b>neutral</b> and <b>flexible</b>. It has to accommodate all kind of content. The player would be integrated into several platforms across countries. Obviously, all platforms have different UIs and different ways of integrating the player. Therefore the main goal was to create a minimalistic interface with <b>customisable UI elements</b>. So the focus was to strip back the UI for pure functionality and build a consistent <b>design system</b>, which can be easily modified for the different platforms.</p>

				<h1>UX evaluation</h1>
			</div>
		</div>
		<div>
			<div class="inner-container">
				<p>When designing the elements of the design we included fast semi-formal usability test after every chunk. At that stage, the goal was to find the areas to improve and iterate.  </p><p>But that can never replace <b>rigorous UX evaluation</b>. So I set up a plan to run an extensive evaluation of the product. The main goal was to measure the walk up ease of use for new users. I choose <b>Initial user performance</b> as the UX measure to evaluate. I have chosen <b>error rates</b> as a metric. We were testing several smaller aspects of the player such as the interaction types, the evaluation etc. Therefore we set the target levels tight to be &lt;1 error per task.  </p><p>The evaluation was planned to be done in four countries. In every country, we test with 1-1 class (usually around 15 students) for each age group. The usability tests were run individually and on a mixture of devices (laptop, phone tablet). 
After the usability test, every task which did not reach the target level was revisited and further iterated.</p>

				<h1>Content</h1>
				<p>Usability doesn’t stop with the interface. At this project, it was equally important to make sure the <b>content</b> what we will display in the player is contributing to a good user experience.  The authors creating content were coming from the mostly printed background and had little or zero knowledge <b>training</b> to explain the possibilities and limitations of online content display.</p>
